## Repository policy

SatNOGS hardware repositories only track source design files. All needed derivative files (e.g. stl, grb etc) for production are created per release, packaged in an archive and uploaded linked to a  [release](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/satnogs-rotator-controller/tags).

Master branch is most times under active development, so expect things to break. For production ready and previous releases source files check tags.
